# vim-castle for homesick

it's my config for vim-related files managed via [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

## install

clone and link this castle:

```
homesick clone lubieniebieski/vim-castle
homesick symlink vim-castle
```

add some `tmp` folders:

```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/tmp/backup ~/.vim/tmp/swap
```
